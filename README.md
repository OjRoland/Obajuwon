The First Practical

I am a Nigerian.
This means I come from an entirely different education culture and background.
We are trained to know the theoretical aspects while completely ignoring the practicals.
So overtime, I(like most in my generation)have developed a do it yourself system as a way of educating myself.
I learnt how to do most things myself and I know this is going to continue as long as I am Nigerian.

Now back to blockchain and crypto currency, I have learnt a lot.
From distributed systems to federated distributed systems and now I'm on cryptoeconomics.
Honestly, it's overwhelming... But it's beautiful and captivating at the same time.

So get ready to hear my updates from time to time because I plan to bore you all with my knowledge until you become interested in what I'm doing.
